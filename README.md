## cosmos-ycsb

This is a database benchmark tool, built from [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB) .

We add features as follows:

1. add cosmoshbase module 
    
   benchmark our [cosmos-hbase-client](http://code.dianpingoa.com/guangbin.zhu/cosmos-hbase-client) 

2. add CustomKeyWorkload 

   load keys from file as custom keys for testing rather than random keys
